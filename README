NAME
    Test::Comprehensive - perform tests on all modules of a distribution

SYNOPSIS
      $ cat t/01comprehensive.t
      use Test::Comprehensive;
      $ make test
      ...

DESCRIPTION
    When using this module in a test script, it goes through all the modules
    in your distribution, checks their POD, checks that they compile ok and
    checks that they all define the same $VERSION.

    It defines its own testing plan, so you can't use it in conjunction with
    other "Test::*" modules in the same file. Therefore it's recommended
    that you just create a one-line test script as shown in the SYNOPSIS
    above.

BUGS
    If you find any bugs or oddities, please do inform the author.
